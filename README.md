Calculator using reversed polish notashion

# Using
This calculator has brackets, operators, constants and functions.

Operators -> "+", "-", "*", "/", "^", "r" - extracting the root.

Functions -> sin, cos, tg, sqrt - square root, cbrt - cube root, abs - absolute value, fact - factorial, comb - combination.

Constants -> pi = 3.1415...; e = 2.71828;

You may write an expression using this operators, functions, constants, brackets, spaces and unary minus. When you write an expression, you must observe following rules:
1. Unary minus write with operand, for example -> "7 + -2"; "2 * -sin(0.3)"; "-(2 + 3)"
2. Use only exist operators and functions
3. Don't write more two minuses between operands, for example -> "2 - -2" - right; "2 - - -2" - wrong
4. Don't use unary plus, for example -> "7 * +8", "2 - +2", "+sqrt(16)" - wrong;
5. Trigonometric functions uses radians
6. Write a decimal fractions with decimal point, for example -> "3.5"; "7.984"
7. List function arguments with ",", for example -> "comb(2, 3)"
8. Don't use "=", this operator denote end of expression
